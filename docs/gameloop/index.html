	<h3>Game Loop</h3>
	<p>
		Inside the Engine2D class there's a Game Loop that handles the input, runs the Physics Engine to update every object and renders everything to the screen. Right before this last rendering, the Engine execute what you, the developer, have written into your code. In fact setting up your Game Loop is really easy. The Engine2D class has a method, called <i>loop</i> that takes in as a parameter a GameLoop object, where you define your loop. I know, the word "loop" is used too much. Furthermore you can define what the Engine should execute before the loop (and so the game) starts and after it ends, before shutting everything down. Let's give a look to the simple code.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="code">
<pre>
<code>
engine.loop(new GameLoop()
{
	@Override
	public void start()
	{
		// What you write here will be executed before the game to start
	}
	
	@Override
	public void run()
	{
		// What you write here will be executed every frame
	}
	
	@Override
	public void stop()
	{
		// What you write here will be executed after the game to end, before closing the program.
	}
});
</code>
</pre>
</div>

		As I promised the code is in fact really really simple. That's because I do not want you to spend too much time on aspects different from the game logic. You handle it, the Engine handle everything else. The final code will look something like this:

<div class="code">
<pre>
<code>
import org.lorenzoleonardini.badger.Engine2D;
import org.lorenzoleonardini.badger.GameLoop;

public class HelloWorld
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		// Create and initialize the 2D engine
		Engine2D engine = new Engine2D();

		// Create the window. Parameters are width, height, scale and title
		engine.createWindow(900, 516, 1, "Hello World!");

		// Set up the Game Loop
		engine.loop(new GameLoop()
		{
			@Override
			public void start()
			{
				/* ------------ What you write here will be executed before the game to start ------------ */
			}
			
			@Override
			public void run()
			{
				/* ------------------- What you write here will be executed every frame ------------------ */
			}
			
			@Override
			public void stop()
			{
				/* What you write here will be executed after the game to end, before closing the program. */
			}
		});
		
		// Start the engine
		engine.start();
		
		engine.logFPS = false;
		engine.logObjects = false;
	}
}

</pre>

	<h3>Legitimate questions</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Are there any differences between a code put into the <i>start</i> method and a code put right before <i>engine.start()</i>?</strong><br />
		Of course yes. <i>engine.start()</i> initialize the Engine and all its features, and it also loads every resources from files. The <i>start</i> method is executed after these initializations and allows you to do whatever you want. On the contrary, code written before <i>engine.start()</i> is executed before the Engine to start: every code that uses Engine components or resources from files will cause a bunch of errors.
		<br /><br />
		<strong>So, are there any differences between a code put into the <i>start</i> method and a code put AFTER <i>engine.start()</i>?</strong><br />
		In this case... I don't know. Giving a first look... no... but because the Engine runs in a separate Thread I don't suggest to do like that. Use the <i>start</i> method. It's there for a reason.
