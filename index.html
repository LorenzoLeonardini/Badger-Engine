	<p>
		Badger-Engine wants to be a 2D & 3D Game Engine written in Java. Right now the only part in development is the 2D one. The Physics Engine is made from scratch and so the Graphics one, which uses <a href="https://www.opengl.org/" target="_blank">OpenGL</a> with the help of <a href="https://lwjgl.org" target="_blank">LWJGL 3</a>. <a href="https://openal.org" target="_blank">OpenAL</a> is used from this library, too.
	</p>
	<p>
		Right now the Engine is under development and this means that all the features described could be not implemented yet. Please check the <a href="#todo">TODO</a> list in the bottom of the page and don't hesitate to contact me if you want to know something.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>
		NOTE: This website graphics is clearly taken from <a href="https://lwjgl.org" target="_blank">LWJGL 3</a>, simply because it's wonderfully clean and lovely.
		</em>
	</p>

	<h3 id="version">Current Version</h3>
	<p>
		The current version is <a href="https://github.com/LorenzoLeonardini/Badger-Engine/releases/tag/v0.3Beta" target="_blank">0.3Beta</a>. It mainly adds collision between moving circles. Still need to fix a bug that causes not moving circles to not really collide well. You can see the exact changelog <a href="https://github.com/LorenzoLeonardini/Badger-Engine/releases/tag/v0.3Beta" target="_blank">here</a>. Remember to follow the development on the <a href="https://github.com/LorenzoLeonardini/Badger-Engine/" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.

	<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
	<p>
		This Engine uses <a href="https://www.opengl.org/" target="_blank">OpenGL 3</a>. Make sure your graphics card (and all your target cards) supports it.

	<h3 id="badger">Why "Badger"?</h3>
	<p>
		Some of you are probably wondering why I've chosen "Badger" for naming this Engine. As many other projects in the world, this one is dedicated to a very special person, who's represented by this name. Only a few will know exactly who I'm referring to and that's the actual point: only the bests know the <i>private</i> story behind it.
	</p>
